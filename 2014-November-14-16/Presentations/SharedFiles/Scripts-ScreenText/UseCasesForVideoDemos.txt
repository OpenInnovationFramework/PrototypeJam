The PrototypeJam team will provide a video production service for each team that will do a demo or other presentation of a prototype.  PrototypeJam video demos and final presentations will include Use Cases but can show the project idea in any way, whether with screen-by-screen mockups, wireframes or even paper prototypes. 

Each PrototypeJam project presentation is expected to create and iteratively refine Use Cases, whether the project demo is a conceptual/design-phase depictions of the idea or demos actual working Prototype software code.  Use Cases describe PrototypeJam projects using diagrams and short structured narratives focused on how users engage the system and/or each other at each of the key action or interaction points of the system.

Use Cases should include Prototype depictions from a user-perspective, that connect:

- Functions to the intended purpose of the user and the outcomes provided by the site, 
- Flow to ease and obviousness of intentions-based navigation “from/to anywhere/anything” including from/to widely varied, interactions/transactions, engagement with content or use of features,  
- Funnels to a particular entry points and site path reflecting and supporting a definite user goal through a series of decision points or other tasks concluding in achievement of the intended outcome) and/or
- Feel to a high quality user-experience based upon the fit of functional capabilities and factors like usability, ease of use, simplicity and pleasure afforded through engaging interactions with the site of the site.

The Use Cases are an important method and mechanism by which teams and projects can be engaged and collaborated with.  The Use Cases will also be an important way the the PrototypeJam provides participating Cities and other stakeholders with actionable artifacts that can be valuable inputs to continuing and evolving design, development and deployment projects that rely on many different types of software and other technologies. While working software is what matters for launch of a production system, it may be that Use Cases provide even greater value over a longer period when composed well conceived sets of functional models, user interactions/flows, defined/documented requirements tied to important/valuable goals, and expected outcomes or performance standards all intelligently integrated with agreed objective testing methods and success metrics.  Use Cases excel at providing the above types of design and architecture phrase contributions to web-oriented products, services or other projects. 

A diagram of the key Use Cases in high quality JPEG or PDF formats can be created using Google Docs or other freely available cross-platform tools.  High quality images of the diagrammatic version for each Use Case is needed in order to display well as a visual element of the Video demo.  Additional templates and examples will be provided in the days leading to the PrototypeJam and each team will have two opportunities to present their Use Cases and other designs to other participants for feedback the first and second week of November, before the start of the PrototypeJam event.
