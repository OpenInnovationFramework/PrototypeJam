1) Do we have a final agenda and roles spelled out, specifically for Sat and Sun? I saw what u included on the blog, Dazza, and apologies that I'm not clear on the structure/roles/flow of the day still. Also wanted to share feedback that while we obviously want to maximize output for the weekend, the amount of time felt, at first glance, a bit intense (e.g., 8am - 11:30pm Sat). I know I won't be able to come close to dedicating that much time given some family obligations and just wondering if others have shared any feedback on this or if I'm missing something. The latter is of course the most likely. :)

2) What is the team and the "team structure" you would recommend we have for Boston folks given the 3 priority outcomes we have discussed? One thing I'm not clear on is how some of us (myself, Chris, Nigel, someone from DoIT, etc) will actually intersect w the people and programmers who will actually be "hacking" -- again sorry if I missed something and now that it's so close to the date, and I just needed to raise directly to do some follow up and expectations from our end. 

3) Are u all set on the sandbox to be able to hack away? What about final selection of what fields we will be focusing on from Biz Hub inquiry and another OBD program form (last I remember we landed on ReStore)? Do we need to be doing any additional deciding/refining of anything else in advance in order to be able to hand over to programmers?

4) Where do things stand on being able to address Chris/Nigel's desired outcome on the legal front, specifically the deep review of Google/Facebook/other identity policies? What else is needed from City of Boston on this front?

5) What else is needed from my or the CIty's end?
